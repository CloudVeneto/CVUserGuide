Managing GPUs
================
CloudVeneto provides also Unipd Physics Dept. and INFN Padova users with some
GPUs (Graphics Processing Units):

- 2 GPU Nvidia TITAN Xp
- 1 GPU Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 e 
- 1 GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX TITAN
- 4 GPU Nvidia Tesla T4

Moreover other 4 GPU Nvidia V100 are going to be installed quite soon.


To use one (or more) of these GPUs, you need to create a virtual machine
with a special flavor, so that the created instance will "see" the relevant
GPU device.
